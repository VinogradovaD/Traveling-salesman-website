### Idea:

Create an SPA application for solving and visualizing the Traveling Salesman Problem.

### Traveling Salesman Problem:
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic algorithmic problem in the fields of computer science and operations research. The problem focuses on finding the shortest possible route that visits a list of cities exactly once and returns to the original city. It is an NP-hard problem, meaning that the number of possible solutions increases factorially with the number of cities, making it computationally intensive to solve as the number of cities grows.
